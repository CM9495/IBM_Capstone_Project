Launch, Land, Learn: ​Data Insights from  Reusable Rockets​
This repository contains a comprehensive data science project focused on the space launch industry. As a data scientist for a "private space launch company", I will apply my analytical skills to real-world space exploration data.

Project Overview

Data Collection: Gather relevant data from multiple sources to build a comprehensive dataset
Data Wrangling: Clean and transform raw data to improve quality and usability
Exploratory Data Analysis: Practice SQL querying to extract initial insights
Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical methods to identify patterns and relationships
Data Visualization: Create visual representations to understand variable relationships
Group Analysis: Drill down into categorical variables to discover deeper insights
Predictive Modeling: Build, evaluate, and refine models to generate predictions
Presentation: Develop a compelling story from your analysis to share your findings
